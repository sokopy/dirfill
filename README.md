# Dirfill
Inspired in the H virus... Here you have Dirfill. It does the same, just random unicode characters instead of
H looking letters. I sure hope nobody uses it in a harmful way, but whatever happens, I am not responsible for
any software or hardware damage on any device that has installed the executable file... Anyways, here's how you
use it.

- Download the [executable file]("https://github.com/sokopy/dirfill/blob/master/dirfill.exe")
- Run it and type "y" to start or "n" to leave. Any other prompt will be ignored and the program will ask you again the y/n question.

As simple as that. There is all you have to do. Anyways, might make a better version later which would put the files in
random directories, but could take a while. Please notice that the repository description is merely comical and I am not
planing to destroy my school computer...
